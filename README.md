```
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun
...
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly.
We thought that it could never end
...
We're lost children of the sea
~ Ronnie Jame Dio

```
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?
~ Metallica - To Live Is To Die
